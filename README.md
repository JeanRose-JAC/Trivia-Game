# Trivia Game
### Project for the course Programming 3

Welcome to our trivia game! This game is our final project for the course Programming 3. It's the result of a collaborative effort between Jean Rose and Anjeli. Jean took charge of developing the game logic, while Anjeli dedicated her skills to crafting a user-friendly UI.

## Game Overview
This trivia game, while straightforward, comes with a personal touch. While it includes default questions, the uniqueness lies in the ability for players to insert their own questions and curate a personalized gaming experience. Step into a world where the game is not just mine, but also yours â€“ an interactive platform where your questions shape the challenge.

## Launch the game
1. Download the Game: Simply grab the .zip file from the release section and unzip it to access the program.
2. Run the Program: Execute the program to play the trivia game.

## How to play: 
Read the question and select one of the choices as your answer. Then, click the Submit button. If you want to continue the quiz, click the Next button. However, if you want to finish it immediately, click the Finish button. All unanswered questions will be set as incorrect. You can save the game summary as a .txt file when the quiz finishes.

## How to load your own quiz: 
You can load your own quiz by clicking the Load button. The app accepts a .csv file. The first column should contain the question, the next four, the multiple choice and the last one, the correct answer.
